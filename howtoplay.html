      <h3>Items you will need</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Paper</li>
        <li>Pencil (or other erasable writing utensil)</li>
        <li>Two 6-sided dice</li>

      <h3>Determining Attributes</h3>
      <p>Before embarking on your own adventure, you must first determine your own strengths and weaknesses. You have in your possession a sword and shield together wiht a rucksack containing provision (food and drink) for the trip. You have been preparing for your quest by training yourself in swordplay and exercising vigerously to build up your strength.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="container_body-howtoplay">
      <h3>Attributes</h3>
      <br>
      <p>TABBYTABFor reasons that will be explained below, Skill, Stamina, and Luck scores change constatnly during an adventure. You must keep an accurate record of these scores and for this reason you are advised to keep an eraser handy. But never rub out your Initial Scores. Although you may be awarded additional Skill, Stamina, and Luck points, these totals may never exceed your Initial Scores. When you will be instructed on a particular page.</p>
      <p>TABBYTABYour Skill score reflects your swordsmanship and general fighting expertise; the higher the better. Your Stamina score reflects your general constitution, your will to survive, your determination and overall fitness; the higher your Stamina score, the longer you will be able to survive. Your Luck score indicates how naturally lucky a person you are. Luck - and magic - are facts of life in the fantasy kingdom you are about to explore.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="container_body-howtoplay">
      <h3>Battles</h3>
      <br>
      <p>TABBYTAB You will often come across pages in the book which instruct you to fight a creature of some sort. an option to flee may be given, but if not - or if you choose to attack the creature anyway - you must resolve the battle as described below.</p>
      <p> First record the creatures\'s Skill and Stamina scores as the Monster Encounter attribute. The scores are given in the adventure each time you have an encounter</p>
      <p>TABBYTABThe sequence of conbat is then:</p>
      <p>1. Roll the two dice once for the creature. Add its Skill score. This total is the creature\'s Attack Strength.</p>
      <p>2. Roll the two dice once for your self. Add the number rolled to your current Skill score. This total is your Attack Strength.</p>
      <p>3. If your Attack Strength is higher than that of the creature, you have wounded it. Procede to step 4. If the creatures Attack Strength is higher than yours, it has wounded you. Proceed to step 5. If both Attack Strength totals are the same, you have avoided each other\'s blows - start the next Attack Round from step 1 above.</p>
      <p>4. YOu have wounded the creature, so subtract 2 points from its Stamina score. You may use your Luck here to do additional damage at this stage (see Luck rules below).</p>
      <p>6. Make the appropriate adjustments to either the creature\'s or your own Stamina scores (and your Luck score if you used Luck - See Luck rules below).</p>
      <p>7. Begin the next Attack Round (repeat steps 1-6). This sequence continues until the stamina score of either you or the creature you are fighting has been reduced to zero (death).</p>
      <br>
      <h3>Escaping</h3>
      <br>
      <p>On some pages you may be given the option of running away from a battle should things be going badly for you. However, if you do run away, the creature automatically gets in one wound on you (subtracts 2 Stamina points) as you flee. Such is the price of cowardice. Note that you may use Luck on this wound in the normal way (see Luck rules). YOu may only Escape if that option is specifially given to you on the page.</p>
      <h3>Fighting More Than One Creature</h3>
      <p>TABBYTABIf you come across more than one creature in a particular encounter, the instructions on that page will tell you how to handle the battle. Sometimes you will treat them as a single monster; sometimes you will fight them each one in turn.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="container_body-howtoplay">
      <h3>Luck</h3>
      <br>
      <p>TABBYTAB.At varous times during your adventure, either in battles or when you come across situations in which you could either be luck or unlucky (details of these are given on pages themselves), you may call on your luck to make the outcome more favourable. But beware! Using luck is a risky business and if you are unlucky, the results could be disastrous.</p>
      <p>TABBYTABThe procedure for using your luck is as follows: roll two dice. If the number rolled is equal to or less than your current Luck score, you have been lucky and the result will go in your favour. If the number rolled is higher than your current Luck score, you have been unlucky and you will be benalized.</p>
      <p>TABBYTABThis procedure is known as Testing your Luck. Each time you \'Test your Luch\', you must subtract one point from your current Luck score. Thus you will soon realize that the more you rely on your luck, the more risky this will become.</p>
      <h3>Using Luck in Battles</h3>
      <p>TABBYTABOn certain pages of the book you will be told to Test your Luck and will be told the consequences of your being lucky or unlucky. However, in battles, you always have the option of using your luck either to inflict a more serious wound on a creature you have just wounded, or to minimize the effects of a wound the creature has just inflicted on you.</p>
      <p>TABBYTABIf you have just wounded the creature, you may Test your Luck as described above. If you are lucky, you have inflicted a severe wound and may subtract an extra 2 points from the creature\'s Stamina score. However, if you are unlucky, the wound was a mere graze and you must restore 1 point to the creature\'s stamina (i.e. instead of scoring the normal 2 points of damage, you have now scored only 1.)</p>
      <p>TABBYTABIf the creature has just wounded you, you may Test your Luck to try to minimize the wound. If you are lucky, you have managed to avoid the full damage of the blow. Restore 1 point of Stamina (i.e. instead of doing 2 points of damage it has done only 1). If you are unlucky, you have taken a more serious blow. Subtract 1 extra Stamina point.</p>
      <p>TABBYTABRemember that you must subtract 1 point from your own Luck score each time you Test your Luck.</p>

      <h3>Restoring Skill, Stamina and Luck</h3>
      <br>
      <p>TABBYTABTABBYTABSkill</p>
      <p>TABBYTABYour Skill score will not change much during your adventure. Occasionally, a page may give instructions to increase or decrease your Skill score. A Magic Weapon may increase your Skill, but remember that only one weapon can be used at a time! You cannot claim 2 skill bonuses for carrying two Magic Swords. Your Skill score can never exceed its Initial Value unless specifically instructed. Drinking the Potion of Skill (see Equipment and Potions for more information) will restore your Skill to its Initial Value at any time.<p>TABBYTABTABBYTABStamina and Provisions</p>
      <p>TABBYTABYour Stamiina score will change a lot during your adventure as you fight monsters and undertake arduous tasks. As you near your goal, your Stamina level may be dangerously low and battles may be particularly risky, so be careful!</p>
      <p>TABBYTABYour haversack contains enough Provisions for ten meals. you may rest and eat only when allowed by the instructions on a page, and only one meal at a time. Eating a meal restores 4 Stamina points. When you eat a meal, add 4 points to your Stamina score and deduct 1 point form your Provisions. Remember that youu have a long way to go, so use your Provisions wisely!</p>
      <p>TABBYTABRemember also that your Stamina score may never excede it\'s Initial Value unless specifially instructed on a page. Drinking a Potion of Strength (see Equipment and Potions for more information) will restore your Stamina to it\'s Initial Level at any time.</p>>
      <p>TABBYTABTABBYTABLuck</p>
      <p>TABBYTABAdditions to your Luck score are awarded through the adventure when you have been particularly lucky. Details are given on the pages of the book. Remember that, as with all Skill and Stamina, your Luck score may never exceed its Initial Value unless specifically instructed on a page. Drinking the Potion of Fortune (see Equipment and Potions for more information) will restore your Luck to its Initial Level at any time, and increase your Initial Luck by 1 point.</p>

    <div class="container_body-howtoplay">
      <h3>Equipment and Potions</h3>
      <br>
      <p>TABBYTABTABBYTABYou wil start your adventure with a bare minimum of equipment, but you may find other items during your travels. You are armed with a sword and are dressed in leather armor. You have a rucksack (haversack, backpack) on your back to hold your Provisions and any treasures you may come across. You also cary a lantern which lights your way.</p>
      <p>TABBYTABIn addition, you may take one bottle of a magical potion which will aid you on your quest. You may choose to take a bottle of any of the following:</p>
      <p>TABBYTABTABBYTABA Potion of Skill  - restores Skill points</p>
      <p>TABBYTABTABBYTABA Potion of Strength - restores Stamina points</p>
      <p>TABBYTABTABBYTABA Potion of Fortune - restores luck points and adds 1 to Initial Luck.</p>
      <p>TABBYTABThese potions may be taken at any time during your adventure. Taking a measure of potion will restore Skill, Stamina or Luck scores to their Initial Level (and the Potion of Fortune will add 1 point to your Initial Luck score before Luck is restored).</p>
      <p>TABBYTABEach bottle of potion contains enough for two measures i.e. the characteristic may be restored twice during an adventure. Each time it is used to make a note on your sheet.</p>
      <p>TABBYTABRemeber also that  you may only choose one of the three potions to take on your trip, so choose wisely!',</p>
