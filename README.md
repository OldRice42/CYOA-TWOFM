# CYOA-TWOF

This is the Choose Your Own Adventure - The Warlock of FIretop Mountain by Steve Jackson and Ian Livingstone in website form. The current goal is to get a working game that includes story choices, the ability to roll dice, keep inventory, and save games. The purpose of this project is to learn Javascript and improve HTML and CSS skills.
